<h1>Building <a href="http://estful.com">Estful</a></h1>

<p class="Warning">This story is an unfinished draft.</p>

<p>I built <a href="http://estful.com">Estful</a>, a site for sharing
recipes and talking about food, for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There were no photo-oriented recipe sites.</li>
  <li>I wanted a significant project with which to learn
    <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a>, experiment with
    server design techniques, and trial Amazon's
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> /
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> /
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">SimpleDB</a>.
  </li>
  <li>I had a long bus commute and I was out of books.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As a hobby project, this was a great success on all three fronts (though I
did get some strange looks programming on a public bus).

<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>
The web server is Jetty, sitting on an Amazon EC2 instance. It is
implemented without frameworks, without a templating library, in
simple direct servlets. Scala's XML literal syntax provides the
equivalent to templating:
</p>

<code><pre>
class Frontpage extends HttpServlet {
  def frontPage() = {
    val body = ...
    &lt;html>
      &lt;head>
        &lt;title>The front page!&lt;/title>
        { Snippits.headers }
      &lt;/head>
      &lt;body>
        { body }
      &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
  }

  override def doGet(req: HttpServletRequest, res: HttpServletResponse) = {
    res.setContentType("text/html")
    val out = new PrintWriter(res.getOutputStream)
    out.println("&lt;!DOCTYPE html>")
    out.println(xml.Xhtml.toXhtml(frontPage, true, false))
    out.close
  }
}
</pre></code>

<p>
This is where the server started, but even after adding support for
headers such as <tt>Last-Modified</tt> and <tt>ETag</tt>, and request
caching to minimise calls to SimpleDB, the <tt>doGet()</tt> machinery
is less than 50 lines long.
</p>

<p>
From here I found the programming of the site was largely dictated by
a few key technical decisions made early on, so I will start with those.
</p>

<h2>The server is stateless.</h2>

<p>
The server maintains no inter-request state in memory or on disk. Each
request looks up any relevant user session or mutable site data in SimpleDB
and S3.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this sounds slow. And when you first set it up, it is slow. Every
HTTP request to Estful involves a couple of HTTP requests be sent to the
SimpleDB and S3 entry points, and they must return before the client sees
a page.
</p>

<p>
This means when you are the only user, page generation time is measured
in milliseconds. Set up a MySQL database and a PHP web site with a connection
pool and page generation time for a single user will be well under a
millisecond. So why go to the trouble of building a stateless server? Because
when you are not the only user, when you are one of thousands, page generation
time is still measured in milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
Both SimpleDB and S3 are designed so you can increase the number of requests
from different machines without increasing average response time. With a
stateless server, it is trivial to run multiple web servers and load balance
even using simple DNS round-robin.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="estful-servers.png" /></p>

<p>
All the issues of communicating between
servers are handled by Amazon's eventual consistency, assuming your site
is designed to the next principle:
</p>

<h2>The database is append only.</h2>

<p>
When someone writes a new article, it gets a new id, and the text and images
are stored under new revision ids. When the article is edited, the next text
is saved to a new revision. To display the article, find the newest revision
(some overwriting is done for pointing to the newest version of data, for
speed). 
</p>

<p>
By simply appending changes to the database with a timestamp and random ids, 
there is no data loss by collision. The only place this is not true is
usernames, where I chose to use the actual username given by the user as an
identifier, instead of generating a random id. This means user creation must
be synchronized outside of SimpleDB to avoid overwriting, as eventual
consistency offers no locking. In reterospect, this was probably a mistake.
Users could also be append only if I had give them random ids.
</p>

<h2>All HTML pages are exactly the same for every user.</h2>

<p>
Most requests come from people not logged in, viewing the site through
the same lens. Some users are logged in and need extra information on
a page, like what articles and comments they have voted on. To manage to
both keep the server design simple and do page caching, my solution for
now is make logged in users make two HTTP requests. The first pulls down
the page, and the second, via JavaScript and XHR, requests extra
information in a JSON format and rearranges the page to match.
</p>

<p>
At the cost of another request for the minority of users, we get to
take easy advantage of the <tt>Last-Modified</tt>, <tt>ETag</tt>, and
cache headers. We can also <b>reduce calls to SimpleDB and S3</b>: when the
server constructs a page to send, it keeps a webserver-local copy with
the last-modified date. If another request comes in, it can just check
the last-modified date against SimpleDB, or if little-enough time has
passed, not even bother and serve the page straight out. This brings
up performance by reducing database calls.
</p>

<h2>Find someone with better infastructure to host static content.</h2>

<p>
S3 is not just used to store text too large to fit in SimpleDB, it also
stores all the recipe photos. Instead of serving those out from my own
server, I just make them public and serve them directly from S3. This
let's the server get on with what it's good at: managing text.
</p>

<p>
It also means if the site becomes busy enough, the photos can be served
by CloudFront to improve response times for end user.
