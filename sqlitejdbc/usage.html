<h1>SQLiteJDBC Usage</h1>
<p>SQLite is <a href="http://sqlite.org/serverless.html">serverless</a>.
This may sound harmless at first, indeed, SQLite seems to work just
like MySQL or PostgreSQL when you wind up the JDBC driver for the first
time. But there are some important differences you need to think about.</p>

<h2>Hurry up and close your ResultSet!</h2>
<p>
Only one Connection can write to the database at a time. That's right,
the <b>entire database locks</b>. Moreover, no write can finish while
there is an open reader. The full and gory details are discussed on
the <a href="http://sqlite.org/lockingv3.html">locking page</a>.
This means you need to close your ResultSet, <b>fast</b>.
</p>

<h2>Queries are cheap</h2>
<p>
Do a lot of queries. They are cheap. Tasks that you would do on a full
DBMS with esoteric features such as cursors should be done on SQLite
with multiple queries. A good example of this is
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=ScrollingCursor">scrolling cursors</a>.
</p>

<h2>When in doubt, use PreparedStatement</h2>
<p>
This holds true for any database, but with SQLite, you get further
benefits. When you call:
</p>
<pre>PreparedStatement prep = conn.prepareStatement(
    "insert into mytable values (?);");</pre>
<p>
The SQL is parsed by SQLite into an intermediate
form, waiting to be filled with a variable and executed. Reusing the
PreparedStatement saves re-parsing the SQL.
</p>

<h2>Transactions are good</h2>
<p>
Almost all writes should be done in a transaction. It is good form,
and if you are doing a large number of updates, it offers great speed
benefits. This is <b>slow</b>:
</p>
<pre>PreparedStatement prep = conn.prepareStatement(
    "insert into mytable values (?);");
for (int i=0; i &lt; 10000; i++) {
    prep.setInt(1, i);
    prep.executeUpdate();
}</pre>
This is <b>fast</b>:
<pre>PreparedStatement prep = conn.prepareStatement(
    "insert into mytable values (?);");
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
for (int i=0; i &lt; 10000; i++) {
    prep.setInt(1, i);
    prep.executeUpdate();
}
conn.commit();</pre>
<p>
This can be further improved with batch routines, but the transaction
is the most important thing!
</p>

<h2>Use the JDBC batch routines</h2>
<p>
JDBC provides many batch interfaces, allowing
you to group tasks together. If you have a large set of statements to
execute, batches will be slightly faster and much more organised:
</p>
<pre>PreparedStatement prep = conn.prepareStatement(
    "insert into mytable values (?);");
for (int i=0; i &lt; 10000; i++) {
    prep.setInt(1, i);
    prep.addBatch();
}
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
prep.executeBatch();
conn.commit();</pre>
Easy.

<h2>Manifest Typing</h2>
To quote the
<a href="http://sqlite.org/datatype3.html:">SQLite documentation</a>:
<blockquote>In SQLite version 3, the
type of a value is associated with the value itself, not with the
column or variable in which the value is stored. (This is sometimes
called manifest typing.)
</blockquote>

<p>
This is important if you use JDBC meta data. The <tt>getColumnType()</tt> function will return the type associated with the value in <b>the currently selected row</b>. This is different from other JDBC drivers.
