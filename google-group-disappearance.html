<h1>The SQLiteJDBC Google Group disappeared unexpectedly</h1>
<p>
There was a moderately-active mailing list for the SQLite JDBC driver on
Google Groups, until it disappeared without warning or notice around
October 2008.
</p>
<p>
The group had nearly 200 active subscribers and held on-topic technical
discussions. The
<a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.sqlite.jdbc">gmane archive</a>
provides ample evidence of this.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure the group's disappearance was entirely accidental, but it is
surprising, given that my experience with other Google services has always
been positive.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update:</b> The group reappeared months later, just as unexpectedly
as it disappared. I have already created another mailing list, so I have
left it be.
